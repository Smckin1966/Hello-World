# Hello-World
Need lots of help :)
I am very new to this and would like to have all the help I can get.
thank you.

I started using the Raspberry Pi a few years ago but wasn't sure what to do with it. Where I work we had a severe server crash that took down our main server that supported a major population of our company. We were without internet, servers, and computers for 5 days. I decided, at that time, that I was going to look more seriously into the Raspberry Pi, and see if it could help me with making back up reserves out of what we do at work. I am in the research phase but I think I created a monster, me. I am hooked.
